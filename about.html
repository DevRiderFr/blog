<p class="text-justify">My first name is <span class="italic-item">Loïc</span>. I am currently working as Full Stack developer in a big IT company. I am full stack developer since 2016. Nothing more to say, I did a pretty standard career at this moment.</p>

<p class="text-justify">In term of passion, I don’t have a lot, but I quite like them. Developing is almost a passion, I am truly enjoying it and coding side projects as well is part of my favourite things to do.</p>

<p class="text-justify">But giving too much space for coding/development stuff is not good for mental health and so on. Then, I discovered a new passion, the motorcycle. Since this date, I never change my mind and I felt in love with this spirit/liberty. Almost one year later (due to driving school issues), I got my driving licence for motorcycle. And there we are!</p>

<p class="text-justify">By filming my road-trips, motorcycles and so on, I discovered another passion: filmmaking. As a big visitor of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, I always watch videos of motorcycles travellers, storytelling about motorcycles, reviews… I made a post about my favourite channel I discovered (either English or French) during my “journey” on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>. I also made a post about my filmmaking gear to summary all the objects I own for producing videos.</p>
